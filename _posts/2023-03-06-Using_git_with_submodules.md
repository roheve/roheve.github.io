## Using git with submodules

I use scripts in puppet modules, but want to keep my scripts in seperate reposotories, so I can clone them for standalone use, without having to copy and maintin the code in two or more places. That is why I use git. Now investigating the use of submodules with git, but also ig that is possible when using puppet codesync.

For now the link on how to use git submodules [Git Tools - Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules "2nd Edition ")

So far, I have not found anything special fin the puppet docs about this, so I need to just test it. Mayby the [puppet documentation for codemanager](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.8/add_content.html "puppet docs") will tell me more, but I do not manage that part of our setup,
