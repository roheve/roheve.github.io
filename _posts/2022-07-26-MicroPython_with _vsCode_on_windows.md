## Using micropython with visual studio code

Found an article series for configuring and ausing vscode for micropython and connecting it to  raspberry pico.

Thw first article is about configuring your windows laptop with the tools you need. See the [Getting Started post](https://medium.com/all-geek-to-me/developing-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico-in-vs-code-getting-started-6dbb3da5ba97 "on medium") with the installation steps.

The second article explains how to use this for coding. This is the [Getting Started](https://medium.com/all-geek-to-me/developing-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico-in-vs-code-start-coding-bb3834233eff "on medium") post and explains it with a 'Hello World' example.

A thist article has hints on how to [configure git to use vscode](https://medium.com/geekculture/configure-visual-studio-code-as-a-default-git-editor-diff-tool-or-merge-tool-291fd7088cc9 "on medium") for it's editor. I am not so sure if I need it, as you can use git from within vscode, but why not configure it both ways.
