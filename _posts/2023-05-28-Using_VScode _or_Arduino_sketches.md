## Using VScode for Arduino sketches

My steps to sdtart using VScode for ardiuno sketches, after I reinstalled my PC. 

My PC at home (for personal use, not my work laptop) is running ubuntu linux and now with a clean install of 22.04.2 LTS. I started with an install of vscode from the repository (which is a snap package) and added some of my regular used extentions.

Because i did not wanted to invent the wheel again, I found [instructions](https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/how-to-use-vs-code-for-creating-and-uploading-arduino-sketches/ "it is not that old"), some of which I already did, and some new pointers.
