## Hello World of Jekyll

This is my first non-test post after configuring and testing my new Jekyll setup. This time setting it all up was easy, I just followed the examples in and read some of the documentation.

It is actually my second try, my first try was many years ago, that ended not well, because then of the installation process was not that easy, and a had steap learning curve to actually use.
