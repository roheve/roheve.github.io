I started with an install of vscode from the repository (which is a snap package) and added some of my regular used extentions.Because I did not wanted to invent the wheel again, I found instructions, some of which I already did, and some new pointers.but first, make sure git is operationalsudo apt install gitgit config --global user.name \"my\"git config --global user.email \"me@roheve.nlThen install vscode.sudo snap install codeAfter it is installed start it and add the arduino extention (which brings the arduino-cli).As I want to use it for the LilyGO T-display-S3 board. I added the board URL for that. The libraries for Expresiff where downloaded, but they where not recognized, so they need to be added.To use the arduino-cli that is integrated in the vscode extention more easy (for debugging my configuration), I added the following alias (I did not want to fiddle with the path). I used locate to find where it was hidden (somewhere in the .vscode folder). Note that it has a hardcoded version, that will likely change.alias arduino-cli=\"${HOME}/.vscode/extensions/vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino-0.6.0-linux-x64/assets/platform/linux-x64/arduino-cli/arduino-cli.app\"Now commands like ‘arduino-cli config dump’ will work as in the documentation, to explore more functionality.
